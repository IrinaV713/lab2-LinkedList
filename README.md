# Doubly Linked List class implementation

*Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) , pointer to the previous node (previous pointer).*

## How to install
1. Install Oracle JDK or OpenJDK
2. Clone this repository on your local computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IrinaV713/lab2-LinkedList
```
3. Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where Main.java file is.
4. Type 'javac Main.java' and press enter to compile your code.
5. Type 'java Main' to run your program.

*When the program is run, you wiil see the demonstration of use of all methods from DoublyLinkedList class*
